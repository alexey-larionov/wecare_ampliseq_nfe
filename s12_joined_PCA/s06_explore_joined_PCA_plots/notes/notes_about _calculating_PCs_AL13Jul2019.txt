AL14Jul2019:

The VCF file with 1850 variants prepared at previous step was taken to HPC to merge with variants from 1kg VCF, prune and calculate PCs in PLINK (see s15-s20 steps in HPC scripts). Then the calculated eigenvectors and eigenvalues were imported back from HPC to laptop.   

PCs from 3 sets of variants were calculated and compared:
- 141 common (MAF>0.05) variants not in LD
- 293 not rate (MAF>0.01) variants not in LD
- all 971 variants not in LD

For all 3 sets the PC1-PC2 plots separated major 1kg populations and located most of Wecare samples amongst Europeans.  293 and 971 plots were very similar.  

The eigenvectors from all 971 variants where taken to use in the downstream analyses.
