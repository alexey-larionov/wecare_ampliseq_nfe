Initially, 17 variants were selected, which where either 
(i)   LoF or 
(ii)  Delerious/damaging missenses or 
(iii) pathogenic in ClinVar.  

After review, only 5 of them were selected for downstream consideration:  
all that had been annotated as "HIGH" impact by VEP.  

Carriers have been selected and BAMs have been reviewed in IGV.  
Only 3 variants/carriers were taken further to be excluded from analysis: 
samples no 48, 137 and 140.  Of them only sample 48 has an absolutely 
convincing evidence; the remaining two samples (137 and 140) are less  
convincing, but still have been kept in the carriers list on the balance 
of evidence and phenotype.  

A previous analysis with different filtering settings: (new versions of 
tools and resources) suggested 4 carriers: 48, 311, 317 and 377.  
These 3 samples have also been included to the carriers list on the 
balance of evidence and phenotype.  

Therefore, the final list of BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 carriers included 
6 samples: 48, 137, 140, 311, 317 and 377.  Of them sample 48 is 
definate and others are reasonably supported by sequencing and phenotype.
