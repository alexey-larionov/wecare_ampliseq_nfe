Notes to PCA analysis on Ampliseq-NFE dataset

Preliminary PCA was performed to evaluate the Ampliseq samples positioning along with major populations in 1KG dataset.  It used 3,219 samples = 715 Ampliseq+2.504 1KG.  It used 971 variants present in both datasets (not in LD). The PCA plots  showed that:
- All re-called NFE samples were co-clustered with European 1KG samples
- most of Ampliseq co-clustered with European 1KG samples
- ~21 samples were co-clustered with African ancestry and ~16 samples were co-clustered with east-asian ancestry 

A definitive PCs were calculated using only 715 samples from Ampliseq+NFE (s21 folder in HPC, s15 folder on laptop).  

Initially, the analysis was based on 1,634 variants (not in LD), which should have included most of the 971 variants used for preliminary analysis. This resulted into 19 outliers (selected on the basis of mean+/- 3*SD on top PCs).  However, these outliers captured only African ancestry, and did not capture any of the samples of east-asian ethnicity, detected during the preliminary analysis (despite the quite a stringent criteria).  

One of the reasons why east-asian ethnicity has not been evident in the Ampliseq-NFE PCA plots would be that the differences are masked by random noise, because of the small number of variants available for analysis.  So, I attempted to reduce the noise by excluding rare variants (AF < 0.01).  Its a standard practice not to include rare variants in PCA.  However, I did not exclude them in the first place because it brought the total number of variants to just 214, which is extremely low (a standard practice in WES/WGS/GWAS is using ~10k random common variants not in LD).  

After exclusion of rare variants many east-asian outliers have been captured. However, not all of clear African and East Asian ancestry was captured still.  So, I used the combined criteria: from Ampliseq-NFE and Ampliseq-1KG PCA plots.  Overall, this identified 46 outliers.
